This project has a separate JSON server, to simulate fetching data from an external API.  
It is a SailsJS server.  
To start the SailsJS server, do the following...  

In a new terminal  
`$ cd jsonServer`  
`$ npm install`  
`$ npm run start`  to start the server.  

Verify it is running by navigating to **http://localhost:1337/restaurants** in your browser, and geting the restaurants JSON.  
Further information about the jsonServer is available in the README.md inside the folder.
